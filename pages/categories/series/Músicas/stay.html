                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)</p>

                I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
                I realize the time that I wasted here
                I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
                Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here</p>

                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
                Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
                You did some things that you regret, still right for you

                Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?
                I give it all just to hold you close

                Oh, oh-oh, runnin' from my love
                I'm not fast, so I'm makin' it worse
                Now I'm diggin' up a grave from my past
                I'm a whole different person
                It's a gift and a curse
                But I cannot reverse it</p>
