            <p class="p_music">Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
                You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
                Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (World?)
                And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
                I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
                Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (girl)</p>

            <p class="p_music">Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
                Not me, if you ever cared to ask
                Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
                God, I wish that I could do that
                I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom
                But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
                But I guess good for you</p>

            <p class="p_music">Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want (ah)
                You bought a new car and your career's really taking off (ah)
                It's like we never even happened
                Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
                And good for you, it's like you never even met me
                Remember when you swore to God I was the only person who ever got you?
                Well, screw that and screw you
                You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do</p>

            <p class="p_music">Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
                Not me, if you ever cared to ask
                Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
                God, I wish that I could do that
                I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom
                But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
                But I guess good for you</p>

            <p class="p_music">Ah-ah-ah-ah
                Ah-ah-ah-ah</p>

            <p class="p_music">Maybe I'm too emotional
                But your apathy is like a wound in salt
                Maybe I'm too emotional
                Or maybe you never cared at all
                Maybe I'm too emotional
                Your apathy is like a wound in salt
                Maybe I'm too emotional
                Or maybe you never cared at all</p>

            <p class="p_music">Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy

                Like a damn sociopath!
                I've lost my mind, I've spent the night crying on the floor of my bathroom
                But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
                But I guess good for you
                Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily</p>
